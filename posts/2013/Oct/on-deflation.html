<p>Deflation is  good word for it. It is the sense of hope and expectations gone awry. I was young when I first became involved in anarchist politics and was filled with the optimism and belief that change on the scale envisioned by anarchist thinkers was not just possible but, in actual fact, inevitable. It would be spurred into form by simultaneous impending crises and an upswing in consciousness, of what was really possible in the ordering of human relations. It’s hard to put it into words, but there was a kind of fantastical element to it, a sense that what existed in the mind could be transformed at will into lived social&nbsp;realities.</p>
<p>Those were of course the heady days of the ‘anti-globalisation’ movement. I got involved sometime towards the end of 2002, and whilst some claim that 9/11 was the death knell for this movement there was still a kind of optimism that persisted in this corner of the world for a couple of years more yet. One wonders though whether, 9/11 or not, this movement would have petered out anyway; whilst some (<a href="http://news.infoshop.org/article.php?story=2007graeber-victory">including David Graeber</a>) have argued that the big protests of this era really did straightjacket the big three (<span class="caps">IMF</span>, World Bank, <span class="caps">WTO</span>), there’s only so long that a movement can survive on ‘summit hopping’&nbsp;alone. </p>
<p>Needless to say, anarchism hasn’t happened yet. And its hard not to feel deflated when coming down from a high of this kind of&nbsp;certitude.</p>
<p>Its easy to devote yourself to something, even at great expense, when you feel certain of a payoff of unimaginable scale. But without this expected payoff, I find myself struggling to find the energy and enthusiasm to devote to anarchist projects. And those projects in which I’m solidly enmeshed become more and more like trudging through a mire of obligation. Cynicism begins to creep in too. One finds oneself watching other projects with a case of déja-vu and a smug surety of their failure, and I don’t want to be that&nbsp;guy.</p>
<p>Compounding this is a scepticism of grandiose statements, a ‘post-structuralist’ moment against grand narratives, totalising analyses, and simplistic answers. I cringe now at the kind of politics that talks of ‘the working class’ or other similar homogenous masses, the kind of politics that offers easy chants at protests but little&nbsp;else.</p>
<p>This isn’t a new feeling. I’ve felt this way for years now. But I’m only now realising that it’s possibly not simply going to pass and that it’s time to learn how to go about working in anarchist projects where I can maintain enthusiasm, feel rewarded and <em>genuinely</em> feel inspired. I haven’t solved this problem yet and, to be honest, writing about it just now is part of step for me to address it. Nonetheless I have a few&nbsp;ideas.</p>
<p>The first idea being that, alongside wholesale social change, perhaps throwing in some more immediate goals into the mix when engaging with a specific project. Whether these are defined collectively or with regards only to one’s own individual participation in a project, they should be clearly defined goals whose achievement can be stated unequivocally. So while ‘raising consciousness’ is perhaps a worthy goal, that’s not the kind of goal I’m talking about here. I’m talking about meaningful goals which are nonetheless much more concrete, which can be measured, and which can can be definitively pointed to and declared as ‘achieved’. On the one hand this means we can easily identify progress within a project, and hopefully feel some sense of achievement and reward, celebrating and being inspired by little victories at each step. On the other hand, for those projects that are failing, perhaps having goals will more clearly spell out when a project is failing, offering up the option of changing course or packing it in. There’s certainly little else more demoralising than persisting on a failing project. Goals like this shouldn’t be amorphous or merely mentioned in passing. I think they should be set consciously, deliberatively and, hell, actually written down for future&nbsp;reference.</p>
<p>Big idea number two concerns the type of projects we pursue. In amongst the kind of projects typically concerned with <em>others</em> (think, for example, anti-war work, solidarity work, poverty work, environmental work etc.) or concerned with ourselves but only very indirectly, we need to be engaging in projects that are immediately (or very nearly so) providing for ourselves. By this I mean engaging in the much-neglected sphere of prefigurative projects—microcosms of the imagined anarchist society—that aim to provide for us directly, either materially (gardens, rural communes, collective workshops, housing coops), intellectually (skill shares, free schools, reading clubs) or spiritually (like social centres). Alone each of these projects pales in comparison to any imagined anarchist society, but society is precisely these things taken all together, and it is only by way of their eclipsing statist, centrist or capitalist modes that we’ll have any kind of revolution to speak of. There’s a very obvious self-interestedness in projects of these sorts that can offset the work involved. Oftentimes we appeal to others self-interest to get them involved in political work (such as workers joining unions), perhaps its time take a dose of this&nbsp;ourselves.</p>
<p>Finally, we need more supportive communities. Political communities tend to be incredibly toxic environments. Put a foot wrong and you’d better have thick skin to take the heat. And perhaps other political communities share this, but certainly in anarchist and far left communities there’s a certain puritanical element. At one time when I first got involved this puritanical space was often concerned with how radical one was, and those occupying it would scorn those who were deemed ‘liberals’ or ‘reformists’. Nowadays, I’d say there’s less of that but still strong puritanical element, often jumping at publicly shaming those who have strayed politically in one way or another, and strangely most often aimed at those closest to ones own political position, relatively speaking. Ironically, I feel we should take the lead from some radical Christian communities. At least here, everyone is already and always will be a sinner, and no one bar the arrogant would claim to occupy any such space of purity. Judgement is replaced with love and forgiveness and a recognition that all are on a journey to learn and grow and better themselves, a path upon which many will stumble too. I’m not advocating a wishy-washy ‘love each other’ politics, because we live in a world delineated by power and hierarchy and wealth and borders, amongst other things. But that (unlike recent arguments I’ve seen to the contrary) I think it actually <em>does</em> matter what your intentions are and that we should be forgiving of stumbling along the way. Certainly, it’s not much fun when one’s overriding concern when engaging in a project of some kind is not putting a foot wrong. And just as importantly, engaging in political disagreements by starting from a position where each acknowledges they might actually be <em>wrong</em> is a whole lot more interesting and less confrontational than simply attempting to one-up or talk over each&nbsp;other.</p>
<p>So that’s about it. I’m sure more will occur to me with time, but these three are where I’m starting from to reengage in anarchist projects even whilst starting from a sense of deflation. There’s a Gramsci quote I’ve wanted to work into this tract but the opportunity hasn’t presented itself. So here, randomly at the end, I give you&nbsp;Gramsci:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m a pessimist because of intelligence, but an optimist because of&nbsp;will.</p>
