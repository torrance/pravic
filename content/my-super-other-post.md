Zleek was born out of a love for <a href="http://anchorcms.com" target="_blank">Anchor CMS</a>. It's a beautiful typography-driven single-column layout with the option for one big, beautiful image. What follows is simply filler text (from the best television show of all time) in order to demonstrate how versatile and tender a lover Zleek can be.

### Top Banana

I'm afraid I just blue myself. Really? Did nothing cancel? There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it. **Not tricks, Michael, illusions.**

- No&hellip; but I'd like to be asked!
- Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough.
- He'll want to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish.

### I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it.

I'm afraid I just blue myself. Michael! Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense. But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn't that mean anything anymore?

1. Really? Did nothing cancel?
1. No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you.
1. I'm a monster.
1. Michael!

### My own selfish brother... Michael

Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right. I'm half machine. I'm a monster. Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He didn't like his trailer. Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He didn't like his trailer. Michael!

### Amigos

There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you ahead in life. She's not <em>that</em> Mexican, Mom, she's <em>my</em> Mexican. And she's Colombian or something. Anyway, it's over.
